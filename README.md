# spring5-reactive

Spring 5 - Spring webflux has a new functional reactive web framework which is non blocking. We can build asynchronous, non blocking, event driven services, that can scale very well.

Migrating from blocking (imperative) style of coding to functional non blocking reactive style of coding helps to define the business logic as asynchronous function calls. This can be done using Java8 method references or lambda expressions. Since the threads are non blocked, processing power is used to the maximum.
Spring 5 is still in milestone release(5.0.0 M5) as of writing this. 

This is a Sample application for examples of Server and Client to build reactive services.

Clone the repository and run the main class.
